### 
Iâ€™m Amitesh Patil â€” a Data Scientist and Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at NC State University, specializing in Data Science.

Iâ€™m passionate about transforming data into impactful insights and solving complex problems using data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and Tableau, I build predictive models, design AI solutions, and craft interactive dashboards to drive data-driven decisions.

Beyond data science, Iâ€™m a football enthusiast â€” both on the field and in the spreadsheets. I love exploring sports analytics â€” uncovering patterns, predicting match outcomes, and analyzing player performance through statistics.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect â€” Iâ€™m always open to discussing data science, football strategies, and the fascinating space where both worlds collide!
