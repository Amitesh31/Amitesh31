### 
Iâ€™m a Data Scientist passionate about turning data into actionable insights. My work spans machine learning, deep learning, and statistical modeling, with projects focused on predictive analytics, remote sensing, and data visualization.

Beyond data, Iâ€™m a huge football fan â€” both on the field and in the spreadsheets. I love diving into sports analytics and using statistics to uncover hidden patterns, whether itâ€™s predicting match outcomes or analyzing player performance.

Explore my projects and feel free to connect â€” always open to discussing data science, football strategies, or the magic where both worlds collide!
